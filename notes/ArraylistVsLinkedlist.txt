ArrayList vs LinkedList difference:

ArrayList has default size of 10 and it doubles once it is full
LinkedList has default size of 0 and keeps increasing size as new elemts are added

In arraylist, memory location is contagious and insertion order is maintained
In Linkedlist, memory location is not contagious, but insertion order is maintained

In ArrayList, internally uses dynamic arraylist and after intro of generics, it supports all types of objects
It internally uses double linkedlist and supports all types of objects

Manipulation is difficult in AL as shifting happens, but insertion and reading is easy
Manipulation is easy in LL
